Map Reduce:
 Map Reduce : MapReduce is a programming model designed for processing huge volume of data in parallel 
 by dividing the work into a set of independent tasks.
 we need to put business logic in the way MapReduce works and rest things will be taken care by the framework
 
 Map output : intermediate out put (saved in local disk)
  
 map reduce run on top of yarn.
  
  
 input -> spliting --> mapping --> shuffling --> reducing (sorting) --> output (list)
      --> words   --> key/value ->          --> word count         --> word: count    

 Map : splitting + mapping
     reduce : shuffling + reducing.
	 
	 
To stop all hadoop instances run the below commands:

installation path :
/opt/hadoop

configuration file:
/opt/hadoop/etc/hadoop

to start /stop services.
/opt/hadoop/sbin
$ start-dfs.sh
$ start-yarn.sh

stops:
stop-dfs.sh
stop-yarn.sh

jps : to get the list of running services.

commands:
vi index1.txt
<enter statement>
esc + :wq

hdfs dfs -mkdir /my_storage
hdfs dfs -put index1.txt /my_storage

hdfs dfs -ls /my_storage/
hdfs dfs -cat /my_storage/index1.txt
hdfs dfs -help

 Map Reduce:
 master : Jobtracker
 Slave : TaskTracker.

Mapreduce implements various algorithm to divide into small parts & assign them into multiple system.
